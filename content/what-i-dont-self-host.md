As a follow-up to [What I Self-Host]({{< relref "what-i-self-host" >}}), here are a few things I intentionally do not self-host.

## Password manager
I use [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) [Premium](https://bitwarden.com/pricing/) for $10/year instead of self-hosting [vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) or [the official Bitwarden server](https://bitwarden.com/help/install-and-deploy-unified-beta/). I don't trust myself with the security of my own vault and I can't tolerate any downtime caused by home power/internet outages or my own server management mistakes.

## Email
I use [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/) [Standard](https://www.fastmail.com/pricing/), which is $152/year for my wife and I, for email, contacts, and calendars. I would feel comfortable using something like Nextcloud for contacts and calendars, but I don't trust myself with the security, privacy, or stability of hosting email for my family, and I assume that Fastmail's spam filtering is more trustworthy than most open source options.

## Media streaming
I don't self-host a media server, like Plex or Jellyfin, because I don't have a local media collection at the moment.

## DNS
I use [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/) [Pro](https://nextdns.io/pricing) for $20/year instead of self-hosting [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) because I don't trust myself to achieve the reliability and speed of a hosted service.


## Budgeting
I use [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/) for [$100/year](https://www.ynab.com/) because I doubt that there are self-hosted options with such reliable transaction importing.
