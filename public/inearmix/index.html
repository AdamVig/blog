$100 is a small amount to spend on a crucial part of
your performance.</p><p>There are two considerations when buying earbuds: build quality and sound
quality. All Shure earbuds are built to last. The SE215s and above have
removable cables, meaning that you can fix your headphones for the price of a
new cable (around $30) instead of having to buy a whole new pair. The SE215s
have a warm, full, reliable sound. You will not miss anything when you wear
these onstage.</p><p>The foam tips provide a tight, bass-enhancing seal that blocks
out ambient noise to protect your hearing. Always wear both earbuds. If you leave
one earbud out, you will damage your hearing. One ear is hearing the loud house
mix and the other is hearing the relatively quiet in-ear mix, so you will
naturally turn up the in-ear mix to compensate. You might not suffer hearing loss
in the open ear, but you will suffer hearing loss in the ear with the loud
in-ear mix.</p><p>Read my guide on wearing the Shure SE215s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b4MDASpO0i5x4Lvz0Hg9bVW1p-gWygIKmWBJi3Tqkyc/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><h2 id=2-the-mix>2) The Mix</h2><p>Do not turn every channel up. Turn the click track or rhythm-keeping instrument
up, then the lead vocalist, then your own instrument and/or vocal. Everything
else is fluff.</p><p>Take advantage of panning. Pan the vocals, drums, or anything else to the
hard left and right to clear out some space in your in-ear mix. This may sound
abstract, but panning is the key to bringing your in-ear mix to the next level.</p><p>Use the ambient microphone. The ambient microphone is intended
to give the musician an idea of what the house mix sounds like and what the
audience is doing.</p></article></main></body></html>
