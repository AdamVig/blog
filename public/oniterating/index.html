better. Apply the process in small pieces.</p><p>Iterating can help you see that your ideas are misguided. Instead of going all
in with an unproven idea, the process of iteration forces you to pick your own
idea apart. If it is a good idea, this process has the byproduct of making your
idea succeed. If it is not a good idea, you will see it and change the idea.</p><p>To iterate is to prove yourself a little bit at a time.</p></article></main></body></html>
