an undeniably huge reach.</p><h2 id=use-geofilters>Use Geofilters</h2><p>Snapchat Geofilters are graphics that users can overlay on Snapchat photos and
videos when they are in certain locations. Geofilters are a great way to
create a brand for a specific location such as a city, a neighborhood, or a
university.</p><p>Snapchat&rsquo;s terms and conditions do not allow the use of logos or trademarks in
Geofilters. Still, your Geofilter can use colors and text to give your brand a
fun personality and to associate it with a specific geographical area.</p><p>It is easy to submit your own!</p><ol><li>Go to the <a href=https://www.snapchat.com/geofilters/>Snapchat Geofilters page</a>
and click the button to get started.</li><li>Design your Geofilter using the guidelines on this page. Optionally, download
and use a
<a href=http://highedwebtech.com/2015/06/25/snapchat-geofilter-template/>template</a>.
Save your Geofilter as <code>.png</code>.</li><li>Click the button to go to the Geofilter submission page on the Snapchat
website. Upload your image. Draw an area on the map in which this Geofilter
should be accessible. Fill out your name, email, and why this location is
meaningful to you. If this Geofilter is for an event, fill out a start and end
time for the event.</li><li>Submit the form and wait for Snapchat to approve your request (it will take
a few days).</li></ol><h2 id=create-an-account>Create an Account</h2><p>Create a Snapchat account for your organization if you want to connect with
people in an organic and personal way. Snapchat accounts are not for posting
advertisements. They are for posting raw behind-the-scenes content that would
not &ldquo;fit&rdquo; on other social networks.</p><p>A great idea for an organization is to purchase a dedicated Snapchat device.
Since Snapchat does not allow an account to be signed in to multiple devices at
once, you will have to log out of your personal account and log in to your
organization&rsquo;s account every time you want to use it. Buy an iPod Touch or iPad
to solve this problem and to allow more people to participate in posting
content.</p><ol><li>Sign up with your organization&rsquo;s email address and, if possible, phone
number.</li></ol><ul><li>One option is to create a Google Voice account with a new phone number
so that the Snapchat account is not tied to a personal cell phone number.</li><li>Set the username to something short and memorable - other people will have
to type it to follow the account on their phones and you will have to type it
every time you log in to the account.</li></ul><ol start=2><li>Configure your settings correctly.</li></ol><ul><li>On the camera screen, tap the ghost icon in the top center then tap the gear
icon on the overlay that appears. This will bring you to your account
settings.</li><li><strong>Name</strong>: Your name is what will show up next to your story. This can have
spaces, capital letters, emoji, and special characters. Use it to
differentiate your organization and make your story stand out. If you do not
set a name, it will default to your boring, lowercase username.</li><li><strong>Mobile Number</strong>: If your account is tied to a personal cell phone number,
disable <em>Allow My Friends to Find Me</em> to avoid associating your organization
with a specific person.</li><li><strong>Manage Additional Services</strong>: Enable Filters here.</li><li><strong>Who Can Send Me Snaps</strong>: Leave this set to <em>My Friends</em> to avoid unwanted
Snaps.</li><li><strong>Who Can View My Story</strong>: Set this to <em>Everyone</em>. This will enable people
to watch your story immediately after they add you without having to wait
for you to add them back. In fact, you should not add people back on Snapchat.
It can make your organization seem <em>too</em> personal and allows potentially
unwanted Snaps from your followers.</li></ul><ol start=3><li>Get snapping!</li></ol><h2 id=share-your-snapcode>Share Your Snapcode</h2><p>A Snapcode is a specialized QR code that allows people to add you on Snapchat by
simply pointing their camera at it or loading an image of it into Snapchat.</p><p>You could take a screenshot of it in the app, but the best place to get a clean
copy of your Snapcode is the
<a href=https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/snapcodes>Snapcode download page</a>. You
will get a <code>.zip</code> file containing your Snapcode in both <code>.svg</code> (vector) and
<code>.png</code> formats as well as a <code>.pdf</code> of guidelines for using the Snapcode.</p><p>Post this image on social networks and print it on posters or handouts so
people can add your account. Always include the username of the account
with the Snapcode in case the code does not scan properly.</p><h2 id=create-awesome-content>Create Awesome Content</h2><ul><li>Post something on your story every day.</li><li>Videos are more interesting than photos.</li><li>Cut to the chase: your followers will skip any part of your story that does
not immediately grab their attention.</li><li>Only post content that would not &ldquo;fit&rdquo; on another social network.</li></ul><p>These are a few general pointers, but there is no formula for creating great
Snapchat content. Be honest, personal, and interesting in your Snapchat stories
to get people talking about your Snapchat account and, better yet, your brand as
a whole.</p></article></main></body></html>
